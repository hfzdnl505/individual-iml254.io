  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My full name is Hafiz Danial Bin Hamizi. I am a student at MARA University of Technology (UiTM) Kedah branch. I am currently on my fourth semester in pursuing my study for the programme IM144 or Library Informatics.</p>
  <p>It is true when they said that time flies really fast. Without realizing it, I have been studying here for almost two years and about to reach the end of my diploma's life.</p>
  <p>Let's get to know a little more about me, shall we?</p>

    <h2>The moment I was born:</h2>
    <p>I was born in the year of 2005 which means that I am 20 years old according to the year. My birth date is 22 in the month of June. I was born in Kelantan which is one of the states located in Malaysia. The hospital I was born in is commonly known as Kota Bharu General Hospital but its real name is Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II.</p>

    <h2>Some of my best moments</h2>
    <p>There were a lot of things that happened to me since I was born. The first one could be when I was in elementary school and made many friends from every race and religion. It is always fun to learn something new.</p>
    <p>Secondly, I would say when I was in my secondary school and in my last year, Form 5, I volunteered to be a ghost for a school fest. It was hilarious.</p>
    <p>Personally, the moments that are precious and can't be replaced are when I am with my family and loved ones.</p>
